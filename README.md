# sudoku
Test problem to practice Haskell

This challenge was thought up at the East Bay Haskell meetup. Not having much real world experience with Haskell, I dove at the chance to solve this.
While I came up with a working solution, it works by brute force mapping over all permutations which is extremely slow and wasteful.
I may attempt to improve this as my knowledge of Haskell improves.
